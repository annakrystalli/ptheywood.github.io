Welcome to the latest iteration of my personal site. After various overcomplicated and unfinished iterations of this site I decided to keep it simple for a change by using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and limiting myself to 3 navigation items: [About](/about/), [Portfolio](/portfolio/) & [Notes](/notes/).

Jekyll was chosen as the platform on which the latest version would be built. It lets me write markdown which is great, use yaml and liquid to simplify navigation and lists of portfolio items / notes.

Hopefully I shoudl keep it a bit more up to date than the laste few versions.
