    <p>
        I'm <strong>Peter Heywood</strong>, research student in the <a href="https://www.shef.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/graphics">VRGraphicS research group</a> of the <a href="http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://shef.ac.uk/dcs/">the University of Sheffield</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        My research is in GPU accelerated microsimulation of transport systems, working towards a Ph.D. under the supervision of <a href="http://www.paulrichmond.staff.shef.ac.uk/">Dr Paul Richmond</a> and <a href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/S.Maddock/">Dr Steve Maddock</a>.

        When I manage to find some free time I work on my own code projects and regularly go kayaking (and very occasionaly compete).
