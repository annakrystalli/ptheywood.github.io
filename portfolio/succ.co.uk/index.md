## Sheffield University Canoe Club
###[succ.co.uk](http://succ.co.uk/)

I've been kayaking since 2006, so when I started at University, I immediately joined the [Sheffield University Canoe Club](http://succ.co.uk) and as one of the few members with web dev experience, began updating their website.

The old version of the site had been made of static html files back before I even started kayaking, which meant that the committee members sometimes struggled to keep it up to date. It was decided that a [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) site would suit the needs of the committee.

The colours of Sheffield University sports teams are Black and Gold, and so a black and (almost) gold themed website was created for the club, with custom data types so that the committee could update and maintain a list of trips, list of committee members and general news posts.
