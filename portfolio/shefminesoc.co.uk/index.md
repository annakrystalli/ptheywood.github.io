## Sheffield Minecraft Society 
###[shefminesoc.co.uk](http://shefminesoc.co.uk/)

While at the University of Sheffield in 2012, a group of Computer Science students formed the [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) society of the Union to socialise with othe minecrafters within the university. I was the Web Developer on the committe for the *2011-2012* and *2012-2013* academic years.

I built a [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) theme in the style of minecraft and added the core content so that other commitee members would be able to update and add content to the site with ease.

**Javascript** was added to animate the clouds accross the header, and also the ghast when moused over. I ended up creating a bug where the ghast's animation could be repeated by repeatidly hoverign over it. I fixed this with the normal behaviour, but left it in as an easter egg.
